# Web-Scraping-IMDB
This project aims to develop a Python program that can automatically scrapes the data from the IMDB top 250 rated movies.
# What is Clustering?
A way of grouping the data points into different clusters, consisting of similar data points. The objects with the possible similarities remain in a group that has less or no similarities with another group. **Link**: https://www.javatpoint.com/clustering-in-machine-learning

## Customer_Segementation
The [Dataset](https://github.com/VaishnavRathod/Customer_Segementation/blob/main/Dataset/Mall_Customers.csv) is containing the information of customers that have visited a mall for shopping. So, the mall owner wants to find some patterns or some particular behavior of his customers using the dataset information. Below is the image representing the information for the dataset:

- RED: Mid Annual Income and Mid Spending Score.
- Blue: High Annual Income and Low Spending Score.
- Green: Low Annual Income and Low Spending score.
- Yellow: Low Income and High Spending Score.
- Pink: High Income and High Spending  Score

## The final result is based on [Silhouette Score](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/cluster/plot_kmeans_silhouette_analysis.html)
Silhouette Coefficient or silhouette score is a metric used to calculate the goodness of a clustering technique. Its value ranges from -1 to 1. 1: Means clusters are well apart from each other and clearly distinguished.
